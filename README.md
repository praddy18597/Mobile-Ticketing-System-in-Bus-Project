# Mobile-Ticketing-System-in-Bus-Project
Build NFC system for Ticketing and Identification of passengers in Public Transport such as 
Bus. So basically, passenger need to carry NFC card with them. As soon as they enter into the bus the Conductor will read the NFC tag using Android Cell phone. The cost would be automatically deduced according to distance travelled from departure to destination.

1.This is the first activity where the Conductor enter the details for authentication. Based on thedetails already stored in the smartphone, it will check if the provided information matches the details already stored in the smartphone. If matched it will go to the next activity. Thus the first activity simply shows the login procedure of the Conductor:
