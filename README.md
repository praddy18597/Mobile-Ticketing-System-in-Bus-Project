# Mobile-Ticketing-System-in-Bus-Project
Build NFC system for Ticketing and Identification of passengers in Public Transport such as 
Bus. So basically, passenger need to carry NFC card with them. As soon as they enter into the bus the Conductor will read the NFC tag using Android Cell phone. The cost would be automatically deduced according to distance travelled from departure to destination.
